JavaScript Language  
Interpreted -> no compilation step for developer, but JS engines do run a compilation step (e.g. assigning objects to scopes) before executing/interpreting the code  
Object Oriented -> obj.function() -> console.log("hello")  
First class functions -> functions can be treated like variables. Passed as params, returned from functions, assigned to variables  
Weakly Typed -> var x = 10; x = "10"; x = true;  
Single Threaded -> hence the importance of async operations (like call backs and promises)  
Function Scoped -> as opposed to Java which is block scoped.
