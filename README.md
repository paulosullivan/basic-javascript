JavaScript Language
Interpreted -> no compilation step for developer
Object Oriented -> obj.function() -> console.log("hello")
First class functions -> functions can be treated like variables. Passed as params, returned from functions, assigned to variables
Weakly Typed -> var x = 10; x = "10"; x = true;
